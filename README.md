# Project: Wine Data Analysis

## Completed April 2022 with members: Herman Liao, Georgia Simkin, Richard Li

This project utilized an analysis with 13 chemical components of wine in order to build a classification model that can predict a wine's type given its chemical constituents. The full project is reported using R in Jupyter Notebook.

*Data source*: UCI Machine Learning Repository
